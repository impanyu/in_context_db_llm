For COT:
To answer the queries, you need to execute the above command step by step, and figure out the current data in the database.

For Few Shots COT:
After executing python command 1, a new database named example will be created.
After executing python command 2, the Customers table will be created with columns CustomerID, CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode, Country, and CustomerID as primary key.
After executing python command 3, the Orders table will be created with columns OrderID, CustomerID, OrderDate, and OrderID as primary key, and CustomerID as foreign key referencing Customers.CustomerID.
After executing python command 4, the OrderDetails table will be created with columns OrderDetailID, OrderID, ProductID, Quantity, and OrderDetailID as primary key, and OrderID and ProductID as foreign key referencing Orders.OrderID and Products.ProductID.
After executing python command 5, the Products table will be created with columns ProductID, ProductName, Unit, Price, and ProductID as primary key.

After executing python command 6, the Customers table will contain custermer with CustomerID = 1,
After executing python command 7, the Customers table will contain custermer with CustomerID = 2,
After executing python command 8, the Customers table will contain custermer with CustomerID = 3,
After executing python command 9, the Customers table will contain custermer with CustomerID = 4,
After executing python command 10, the Orders table will contain order with OrderID = 10308,
After executing python command 11, the Orders table will contain order with OrderID = 10365,
After executing python command 12, the Customers table will not contain custermer with CustomerID = 4, and only contain custermer with CustomerID = 1, 2, 3,
After executing python command 13, the order with OrderID = 10308 will have OrderDate = '9/19/1996',
After executing python command 14, the OrderDetails table will contain order detail with OrderDetailID = 162,
fter executing python command 15, the OrderDetails table will contain order detail with OrderDetailID = 163,
After executing python command 16, the OrderDetails table will contain order detail with OrderDetailID = 314,
After executing python command 17, the Products table will contain product with ProductID = 11,
After executing python command 18, the Products table will contain product with ProductID = 69,
After executing python command 19, the Products table will contain product with ProductID = 70,
After executing python command 20, the Products table will contain product with ProductID = 1,
After executing python command 21, the Products table will not contain product with ProductID = 1, and only contain product with ProductID = 11, 69, 70.

Now if the user send query:
return the CustomerID for the customer who ordered the product with ProductID = 11
then the query result is 3.

If the user send query:
return the number of products with price greater than 20
then the query result is 2.

If the user send query:
return the order date for the order with OrderID = 10308
then the query result is 9/19/1996.

If the user send query:
insert a new customer with CustomerID = 5, CustomerName = 'Around the Horn', ContactName = 'Thomas Hardy', Address = '120 Hanover Sq.', City = 'London', PostalCode = 'WA1 1DP', Country = 'UK'
then the query will be successfully executed.

If the user send query:
insert an order with OrderID = 10249, CustomerID = 4, OrderDate = '7/5/1996'
then the query will fail, with foreign key constraint violation.


If the user send query:
insert an product with ProductID = 11, ProductName = 'Queso Cabrales', Unit = '1 kg pkg.', Price = 21
then the query will fail, with primary key constraint violation.

If the user send query:
delete the customer with CustomerID = 1
then the query will be successfully executed

If the user send query:
delete the order with OrderID = 10308
then the query will fail, with foreign key constraint violation.


If the user send query:
update the row in OrderDetails with OrderDetailID = 162 to set Quantity = 2
then the query will be successfully executed.


If the user send query:
update the row in OrderDetails with OrderDetailID = 162 to set ProductID = 1
then the query will fail, with foreign key constraint violation.



Now pretend you are a database which has already executed the above commands.
Next you will receive a query from the user
You need to execute the query and reply to the user with the standard output of query.
The query is as follows:
